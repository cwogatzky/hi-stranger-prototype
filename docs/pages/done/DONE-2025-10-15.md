# ✅ HI STRANGER – DONE SUMMARY (as of 17 Oct 2025)

## System & Infrastructure
- **Local development environment restored**  
  Wrangler configuration, server paths, and `.assetsignore` fixed.  
  Original startup command `wrangler pages dev ./ --local` successfully reactivated.

- **Recovery after structural loss**  
  After an accidental file move, all core files (`index.html`, `/js/`, `/docs/`, `/functions/api/`) were restored and verified.  
  Full local and Cloudflare environment functionality confirmed.

- **Docs Viewer Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)**  
  Live deployment functional on port 8788 with hash-routing viewer.  
  `_files.json` rebuilt, folder links verified, and structure validated.  

---

## Frontend – Profile Manager
- **Profile table & rendering**  
  Display of all stored profiles (including `assertiveness`, `empathy`, `stress`, `regulation`) with per-user chat activation toggles.  
  Filters, selections, and bulk actions stable.

- **Profile Editor (Lightbox)**  
  Centered modal layout with 180px top/bottom margins and editable fields.  
  UI logic aligned with `USER_PROFILE.md`: text fields, radios, checkboxes, sliders.  
  Sections collapsed by default, with “Expand all” toggle available.

- **buildProfileEditorHTML**  
  Dynamic field generation based on section structure (`intent`, `behavior`, `emotional`, `interests`).  
  Includes all selectable options from the questionnaire definition.

- **wireProfileEditor & event binding**  
  Input changes now sync directly with the JSON object.  
  State handling and live updates fully functional.

---

## Persistence & Storage
- **Profile loading (pagination fix)**  
  Cursor handling improved (previous cutoff at 10,000 entries).  
  Count function (`refreshKVCountOnly`) now displays the correct total number of profiles.

- **Local Chat Profiles (CHAT_MAP / LocalStorage)**  
  Chat-enabled profile selections now persist correctly in browser local storage.

- **Storage Refactor (LIVE-Ready)**  
  KV/D1 layer complete, NDJSON import + validation working.  
  Documentation updated (`DATA_STORAGE_CONCEPT.md`, `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`, `LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md`).  
  Idempotency and schema validation confirmed.

---

## Error Handling & Stability
- **Wrangler error analysis (EMFILE, 500/422)**  
  Root cause identified (wrong mode, excessive open file handles).  
  Fixed by adding `.assetsignore` and returning to correct Pages Dev mode.

- **API endpoint debugging**  
  PUT/POST error 422 traced to schema validation.  
  Updated local handling to send valid NDJSON envelopes.  
  Save path verified in local test.

---

## Documentation
- **File structure verified and restored**  
  `/docs/pages/` with subfolders (`AI_briefs`, `data_entities`, `done`, `backlogs`, `developer_briefs`) confirmed.  
  Directory structure fixed as baseline for future updates.  

- **Documentation Suite Refactor**  
  Created unified structure (`INDEX.md`, `README.md`, `AI_briefs`, `developer_briefs`).  
  `DEV_NOTES.md`, `DEV_COLLAB_GUIDE.md`, and `SCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md` aligned with live build.  
  Docs Viewer integration confirmed.

- **Security & Privacy Documentation Update**  
  `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` aligned with `DATA_STORAGE_CONCEPT.md`.  
  Added audit logging, key rotation, and envelope encryption overview.
