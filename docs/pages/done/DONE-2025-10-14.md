# ✅ HI STRANGER – DONE SUMMARY (as of 15 Oct 2025)

## System & Infrastructure
- **Local development environment restored**  
  Wrangler configuration, server paths, and `.assetsignore` fixed.  
  Original startup command `wrangler pages dev ./ --local` successfully reactivated.

- **Recovery after structural loss**  
  After an accidental file move, core files (`index.html`, `/js/`, etc.) were recovered and verified.  
  Full environment functionality confirmed.

---

## Frontend – Profile Manager
- **Profile table & rendering**  
  Display of all stored profiles (including `assertiveness`, `empathy`, `stress`, `regulation`) with per-user chat activation toggles.  
  Filters, selections, and bulk actions stable.

- **Profile Editor (Lightbox)**  
  New centered modal layout with 180px top/bottom margins and fully editable input fields.  
  UI logic aligned with `USER_PROFILE.md`: text fields, radios, checkboxes, and sliders.  
  Sections collapsed by default, with “Expand all” toggle available.

- **buildProfileEditorHTML**  
  Dynamic field generation based on section structure (`intent`, `behavior`, `emotional`, `interests`)  
  Includes all selectable options from the questionnaire definition.

- **wireProfileEditor & event binding**  
  Input changes now sync directly with the JSON object.  
  State handling and live updates fully functional.

---

## Persistence & Storage
- **Profile loading (pagination fix)**  
  Cursor handling improved (previous cutoff at 10,000 entries).  
  Count function (`refreshKVCountOnly`) now displays the correct total number of profiles.

- **Local Chat Profiles (CHAT_MAP / LocalStorage)**  
  Chat-enabled profile selections now persist correctly in browser local storage.

---

## Error Handling & Stability
- **Wrangler error analysis (EMFILE, 500/422)**  
  Root cause identified (wrong mode, excessive open file handles).  
  Fixed by adding `.assetsignore` and returning to correct Pages Dev mode.

- **API endpoint debugging**  
  PUT/POST error 422 traced to schema validation.  
  Updated local handling to send valid NDJSON envelopes.  
  Save path verified in local test.

---

## Documentation
- **File structure verified and restored**  
  `/docs/pages/` with subfolders (`AI_briefs`, `data_entities`, `done`, `backlogs`) confirmed.  
  Directory structure fixed as baseline for future updates.
