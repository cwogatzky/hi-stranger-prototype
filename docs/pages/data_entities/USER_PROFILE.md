# USER_PROFILE

## Design Purpose
User Profile defines the **human layer** of Hi Stranger â€” the personal, psychological, and social framework that drives how each participant interacts.  
It turns static user data into a **living identity model** used by the moderation and personalization engines.

### Why it exists
- **Personalization:** Adapts tone, depth, and moderation flow to the userâ€™s traits.  
- **Consistency:** Keeps the userâ€™s communication style stable across sessions.  
- **Empathy Modeling:** Enables AI to predict comfort zones and avoid friction.  
- **Matchmaking:** Provides a semantic base for compatible chat pairings.  
- **Growth Reflection:** Tracks self-reported traits that evolve over time.

### Summary
| Function | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|
| Structural | Core representation of user personality and preferences |
| Adaptive | Guides moderation tone, prompts, and translation |
| Analytical | Enables trait-based matchmaking and trend analysis |
| Experiential | Creates coherent, deeply personal experiences |
